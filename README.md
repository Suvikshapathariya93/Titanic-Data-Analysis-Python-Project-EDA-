## EDA: Box plot, Conditional Formatting, Null values

1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for investigating relationships between variables like age and passenger class.
```python
#This plot provides insights into the age demographics of passengers within each class. For instance, it helps determine if certain classes had younger or older passengers on average.
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
sns.boxplot(x = 'Pclass', y = 'Age', data = df, palette = 'icefire')
```
- ```plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))```: Sets the figure size to 12 inches wide and 6 inches tall, ensuring the plot is well-proportioned and easy to read.
- ```sns.boxplot```: Creates a box plot using the Seaborn library.
- ```x='Pclass'```: Specifies the "Pclass" (Passenger Class) column for the x-axis, representing classes (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third).
- ```y='Age'```: Specifies the "Age" column for the y-axis, showing the age distribution for each class.
- ```data=df```: Uses the dataset df as the source for the plot.
- ```palette='icefire'```: Applies the "icefire" color palette to the box plot for aesthetic styling.
- ```plt.show()```: Displays the final plot.
- **Shows statistical information such as:**
  - Median age for each class.
  - Interquartile range (IQR), which highlights the middle 50% of the data.
  - Outliers (ages significantly above or below the usual range).
 
2. Apply conditional formatting to fill null values.
```python
#This function is designed to impute missing values in the "Age" column of the dataset based on the passenger class (Pclass).
def  impute_age(cols):
  Age = cols[0]
  Pclass = cols[1]
  if pd.isnull(Age):
    if Pclass == 1:
      return 37
    elif Pclass == 2:
      return 29
    else : 
      return 20
  else: 
   return Age
```
- Input:
  - cols: A pair of values ‚Äî Age (the passenger's age) and Pclass (the passenger class: 1, 2, or 3).
- Logic:
  - If the Age is missing ```(pd.isnull(Age))```, the function assigns an age based on the passenger class:
    - Class 1: Replace missing age with 37 (assumed median age for 1st class passengers).
    - Class 2: Replace missing age with 29.
    - Class 3: Replace missing age with 20.
    - If the Age is not missing, the function returns the original Age value.
- Output: The function returns either the imputed age (based on class) or the existing age.

- **Why Is This Useful?**
   - Missing values in numerical columns like Age can cause issues in data analysis or machine learning models.
   - Imputing missing values based on a related feature like Pclass ensures that the replacements are more accurate and meaningful compared to a single overall average.
    - For example, 1st-class passengers may generally be older, while 3rd-class passengers may have younger ages, so this approach considers class-wise trends.

3. Apply above function
```python
df['Age'] = df[['Age', 'Pclass']].apply(impute_age, axis = 1)
```
- This line applies the ```impute_age``` function to the DataFrame ```df``` and replaces the missing values in the "Age" column.
- It uses the values of the "Age" and "Pclass" columns as inputs to decide the replacement for missing ages.

4. Drop the unwanted columns
```python
df.drop(['Sex', 'Embarked', 'Name', 'Ticket'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
```
- ```df.drop()```: The drop() function is used to remove specific rows or columns.
- ```['Sex', 'Embarked', 'Name', 'Ticket']```: This is the list of column names that are being removed.
- ```axis=1```: Specifies that the operation is performed on columns.
- ```inplace=True```: Modifies the DataFrame in place, meaning no new DataFrame is created, and the original df is updated.

## Machine Learning model: Logistic Regression, Prediction model
1. Split the data for model in into test and train
```python
# Building a machine learning model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(df.drop('Survived', axis =1), df['Survived'], test_size = 0.30, random_state = 101)
```
- ```train_test_split()```: A function from sklearn used to split the data into training and testing subsets.
- ```df.drop('Survived', axis=1)```: Removes the target column (Survived) from the DataFrame to create the feature matrix (X).
- ```df['Survived']```: Extracts the target variable (Survived) from the DataFrame.
- ```test_size=0.30```: Specifies that 30% of the data will be used for testing, while the remaining 70% will be used for training.
- ```random_state=101```: Ensures that the split is reproducible. The same split will occur every time the code is run with this random_state.

- **Why This Line Is Useful**:
    - Training Set (X_train, Y_train): Used to train the machine learning model.
    - Testing Set (X_test, Y_test): Used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
    - Ensures that the "Survived" column (target) is isolated for prediction purposes, while other columns are used as features.

2. Feature scaling
```python
#This code standardizes the features in the training and testing datasets to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, a crucial step in preprocessing for machine learning models.
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc.transform(X_test)
print(X_train)
```
- ```StandardScaler```: A preprocessing tool from sklearn that standardizes data by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
- Create the Scaler Object (sc):
  - ```sc``` = ```StandardScaler()```: Initializes the scaler.
- Fit and Transform the Training Data:
  - ```sc.fit_transform(X_train)```: Computes the mean and standard deviation of the X_train features.
  - Standardizes the training data: The transformed ```X_train``` now has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 for each feature.
- Transform the Testing Data:
  - ```sc.transform(X_test)```: Uses the mean and standard deviation from the training data to standardize X_test.
                                Ensures consistency between training and testing datasets.
- Print Scaled Training Data: ```print(X_train)``` displays the standardized X_train dataset.

- **Why This Line Is Useful:**
    - Standardization Benefits:
      - Helps models (like logistic regression, SVMs, or neural networks) perform better by ensuring features are on the same scale.
      - Avoids bias caused by features with large magnitudes dominating others.
    - Training-Testing Consistency: Ensures that the same scaling is applied to both the training and testing sets for reliable model evaluation.
   
3. Training the model
```python
#This code creates and trains a logistic regression model using the training dataset.
Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to predict discrete outcomes, such as whether a passenger survived or not in the Titanic dataset.
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression(random_state = 101)
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)
```
- Import Logistic Regression:
  - ```from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression```: Imports the logistic regression model from scikit-learn's linear models library.
- Create the Model:
  - ```model = LogisticRegression(random_state=101)```: Initializes a logistic regression model.
  - The ```random_state``` parameter ensures the process is reproducible when randomness is involved (e.g., in solvers or regularization).
- Train the Model:
  - ```model.fit(X_train, Y_train)```: Fits the logistic regression model to the training data.
  - ```X_train```: The feature set (independent variables).
  - ```Y_train```: The target variable (dependent variable, e.g., survival status).
- What Happens During Training:
  - The logistic regression model learns the relationship between the features in X_train and the target variable Y_train.
  - It optimizes the coefficients for each feature to best predict the target outcome.

- **Why This Line Is Useful:**
  - Logistic regression is simple yet powerful for binary classification tasks (like predicting survival in the Titanic dataset).
  - By training the model, it is ready to make predictions on new data (e.g., testing data).

- **Output:**
  - The model object is trained and contains the learned parameters (coefficients and intercepts) that can be used to make predictions. 

4. Prediction with confusion matrix
```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score
```
- This code imports two evaluation metrics from sklearn to measure the performance of a machine learning model:
  - ```confusion_matrix```: Provides a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions versus actual outcomes.
  - ```accuracy_score```: Calculates the overall accuracy of the model's predictions.

- **Explanation**
  
a. ```confusion_matrix```: A table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by showing the number of:
  - True Positives (TP): Correctly predicted positives.
  - True Negatives (TN): Correctly predicted negatives.
  - False Positives (FP): Incorrectly predicted as positive.
  - False Negatives (FN): Incorrectly predicted as negative.
b. ```accuracy_score```: Measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total predictions made by the model:
  - ```accuracy = correct prediction/ Total prediction```
  - Gives a single metric to evaluate the model's overall performance.

- **Why This Line Is Useful:**
  - Confusion Matrix:
    - Provides detailed insight into the types of errors the model makes, which is especially useful for imbalanced datasets.
    - Helps identify if the model is biased toward one class.
  - Accuracy Score:
    - Offers a quick way to understand how well the model performs overall.
    - Easy to compute and interpret for balanced datasets.
   
- **Output:**
  - ```Confusion Matrix```: A matrix showing the count of true and false predictions for each class.
  - ```Accuracy Score```: A numeric value between 0 and 1 (or 0% to 100%) representing overall accuracy.

```python
#This code uses a trained machine learning model to make predictions on the testing dataset and evaluates the predictions using a confusion matrix.
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

accuracy = confusion_matrix(Y_test, predictions)
accuracy

accuracy = accuracy_score(Y_test, predictions)
accuracy
```
- **Making Predictions**: Using the model to predict the target values for the test dataset.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Generating a matrix to analyze the performance by comparing actual and predicted outcomes.
- **Accuracy Score**: Calculating the overall percentage of correct predictions.

- **Why This Line Is Useful:**
  - Confusion Matrix: Provides detailed insight into the types of predictions (correct vs incorrect) made by the model.
  - Accuracy Score: Offers a quick and intuitive measure of the model‚Äôs performance as a percentage or decimal.
