## Extracting Insights from the Dataset through visualization

1. Visualize the null value through HeatMap.
```python
#This code visualizes the missing data in the dataset, making it easy to identify which columns or rows have null (missing) values and their distribution.
sns.heatmap(df.isnull())
plt.show()
```
- ```sns.heatmap```: Creates a heatmap visualization using the Seaborn library.
- ```df.isnull()```: Generates a DataFrame of the same shape as df, where each cell is True if the value is missing (NaN) and False otherwise.
**The heatmap highlights missing data in the dataset, where True values are usually represented by brighter colors and False values by darker colors.**
- ```plt.show()```: Displays the heatmap.

2. Visualize the survival distribution across genders.
```python
#Purpose :This code visualizes the survival distribution across genders, helping to identify gender-based survival trends in the Titanic dataset.
sns.catplot(x='Survived', col='Sex', kind='count', data=df)
plt.show()
```
- ```sns.catplot```: Creates a categorical plot using the Seaborn library.
- ```x='Survived'```: Sets the x-axis to the "Survived" column, showing survival status (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived).
- ```col='Sex'```: Separates the plot into two subplots, one for each gender ("Male" and "Female").
- ```kind='count'```: Displays a count plot, showing the frequency of each survival status for each gender.
- ```data=df```: Uses the Titanic dataset stored in the DataFrame df.
- ```plt.show()```: Displays the generated plots.

3. Visualize the survival distribution across passenger classes.
```python
#Purpose : Visualizes the survival distribution across passenger classes to highlight the influence of class on survival.
sns.countplot(x='Survived', hue='Pclass', data=df)
```
- ```sns.countplot```: Creates a count plot using the Seaborn library.
- ```x='Survived'```: Sets the x-axis to the "Survived" column, showing survival status (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived).
- ```hue='Pclass'```: Adds color coding by "Pclass" (Passenger Class: 1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third), allowing differentiation by passenger class.
- ```data=df```: Uses the Titanic dataset stored in the DataFrame df.

4. Visualize the survival distribution acorss different genders and passenger classes together.
```python
#Purpose: This code visualizes the survival distribution across different genders and passenger classes. It helps identify patterns, such as whether survival rates were influenced by gender or passenger class.
sns.catplot(x='Survived', col='Sex', hue='Pclass', kind='count', data=df)
```
- ```sns.catplot```: Creates a categorical plot using the Seaborn library.
- ```x='Survived'```: Sets the x-axis to the "Survived" column, showing survival status (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived).
- ```col='Sex'```: Separates the plot into two subplots, one for each gender ("Male" and "Female").
- ```hue='Pclass'```: Adds color coding by "Pclass" (Passenger Class: 1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third) to show survival distribution by class within each gender.
- ```kind='count'```: Displays a count plot, showing the frequency of each survival status for each class and gender combination.
- ```data=df```: Uses the Titanic dataset stored in the DataFrame df.

sns.displot(df['Age'].dropna(), kde=False, color='darkgreen', bins=40)
plt.show()
```
- ```sns.displot```: Creates a distribution plot using the Seaborn library.
- ```df['Age']```: Specifies the "Age" column from the dataset to analyze the distribution of ages.
- ```.dropna()```: Removes any missing values (NaN) from the "Age" column to ensure only valid data is plotted.
- ```kde=False```: Disables the Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) curve, leaving only the histogram to represent the data.
- ```color='darkgreen'```: Sets the color of the bars in the histogram to dark green.
- ```bins=40```: Divides the range of ages into 40 equal intervals (bins), ensuring a detailed view of the distribution.
- ```plt.show()```: Displays the plot.

6. Visualize the number of passengers with varying counts of Siblings/Spouse aboard.
```python
#This count plot provides a visual summary of the number of passengers with varying counts of siblings/spouses aboard. It helps analyze the family size distribution among passengers.
sns.countplot(x = 'SibSp', data = df)
```
- ```sns.countplot```: Creates a count plot using the Seaborn library.

- ```data=df```: Specifies the dataset (df) as the source for the plot.
- ```plt.show()```: Displays the generated plot.

## EDA: Box plot, Conditional Formatting, Null values

1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for investigating relationships between variables like age and passenger class.
```python
#This plot provides insights into the age demographics of passengers within each class. For instance, it helps determine if certain classes had younger or older passengers on average.
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
sns.boxplot(x = 'Pclass', y = 'Age', data = df, palette = 'icefire')
```
- ```plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))```: Sets the figure size to 12 inches wide and 6 inches tall, ensuring the plot is well-proportioned and easy to read.
- ```sns.boxplot```: Creates a box plot using the Seaborn library.
- ```x='Pclass'```: Specifies the "Pclass" (Passenger Class) column for the x-axis, representing classes (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third).
- ```y='Age'```: Specifies the "Age" column for the y-axis, showing the age distribution for each class.
- ```data=df```: Uses the dataset df as the source for the plot.
- ```palette='icefire'```: Applies the "icefire" color palette to the box plot for aesthetic styling.
- ```plt.show()```: Displays the final plot.
- **Shows statistical information such as:**
  - Median age for each class.
  - Interquartile range (IQR), which highlights the middle 50% of the data.
  - Outliers (ages significantly above or below the usual range).
 
2. Apply conditional formatting to fill null values.
```python
#This function is designed to impute missing values in the "Age" column of the dataset based on the passenger class (Pclass).
def  impute_age(cols):
  Age = cols[0]
  Pclass = cols[1]
  if pd.isnull(Age):
    if Pclass == 1:
      return 37
    elif Pclass == 2:
      return 29
    else : 
      return 20
  else: 
   return Age
```
- Input:
  - cols: A pair of values ‚Äî Age (the passenger's age) and Pclass (the passenger class: 1, 2, or 3).
- Logic:
  - If the Age is missing ```(pd.isnull(Age))```, the function assigns an age based on the passenger class:
    - Class 1: Replace missing age with 37 (assumed median age for 1st class passengers).
    - Class 2: Replace missing age with 29.
    - Class 3: Replace missing age with 20.
    - If the Age is not missing, the function returns the original Age value.
- Output: The function returns either the imputed age (based on class) or the existing age.

- **Why Is This Useful?**
   - Missing values in numerical columns like Age can cause issues in data analysis or machine learning models.
   - Imputing missing values based on a related feature like Pclass ensures that the replacements are more accurate and meaningful compared to a single overall average.
    - For example, 1st-class passengers may generally be older, while 3rd-class passengers may have younger ages, so this approach considers class-wise trends.

3. Apply above function
```python
df['Age'] = df[['Age', 'Pclass']].apply(impute_age, axis = 1)
```
- This line applies the ```impute_age``` function to the DataFrame ```df``` and replaces the missing values in the "Age" column.
- It uses the values of the "Age" and "Pclass" columns as inputs to decide the replacement for missing ages.

4. Drop the unwanted columns
```python
df.drop(['Sex', 'Embarked', 'Name', 'Ticket'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
```
- ```df.drop()```: The drop() function is used to remove specific rows or columns.
- ```['Sex', 'Embarked', 'Name', 'Ticket']```: This is the list of column names that are being removed.
- ```axis=1```: Specifies that the operation is performed on columns.
- ```inplace=True```: Modifies the DataFrame in place, meaning no new DataFrame is created, and the original df is updated.

## Machine Learning model: Logistic Regression, Prediction model
```python
# Building a machine learning model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(df.drop('Survived', axis =1), df['Survived'], test_size = 0.30, random_state = 101)
```
- ```train_test_split()```: A function from sklearn used to split the data into training and testing subsets.
- ```df.drop('Survived', axis=1)```: Removes the target column (Survived) from the DataFrame to create the feature matrix (X).
- ```df['Survived']```: Extracts the target variable (Survived) from the DataFrame.
- ```test_size=0.30```: Specifies that 30% of the data will be used for testing, while the remaining 70% will be used for training.
- ```random_state=101```: Ensures that the split is reproducible. The same split will occur every time the code is run with this random_state.

- **Why This Line Is Useful**:
  - Training Set (X_train, Y_train): Used to train the machine learning model.
  - Testing Set (X_test, Y_test): Used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
  - Ensures that the "Survived" column (target) is isolated for prediction purposes, while other columns are used as features.
